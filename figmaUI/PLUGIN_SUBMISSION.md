## Description

**AI Auto Naming** is an intelligent Figma plugin that leverages AI technology to automatically generate semantic, meaningful names for your design elements. Save time and maintain consistency across your design files with AI-powered naming suggestions.

### Key Features

🤖 **AI-Powered Naming**: Automatically generates semantic names based on element type, description, and context. The AI understands the purpose and function of each element to suggest appropriate names.

🖼️ **Visual Analysis**: Supports screenshot analysis - the AI can understand element appearance and functionality by analyzing visual content, ensuring more accurate naming suggestions.

📦 **Batch Processing**: Process multiple frames and their children in one go. Rename entire design systems efficiently with batch operations.

🎯 **Frame Structure Analysis**: Analyze entire frame structures and return all nodes that need naming. The plugin intelligently identifies which elements require better names.

🔍 **Smart Recognition**: Automatically identifies different element types including FRAME, COMPONENT, GROUP, BUTTON, INSTANCE, and more, applying appropriate naming conventions for each.

💡 **Context-Aware**: Generates accurate names by understanding element descriptions, parent information, and sibling elements. The AI considers the hierarchical structure and relationships between elements.

### How It Works

1. Select elements (Frame, Component, etc.) in your Figma canvas
2. Run the plugin from the Plugins menu
3. The plugin automatically calls the AI service to analyze your design elements
4. Review and apply the suggested semantic names
5. Maintain consistent, meaningful naming across your entire design system

### Use Cases

- **Design System Maintenance**: Keep your design system organized with consistent, semantic naming
- **Component Library Management**: Automatically name components and their variants
- **Design Handoff**: Ensure developers receive well-named design elements
- **Team Collaboration**: Maintain naming consistency across team members
- **Large Projects**: Quickly rename hundreds of elements in complex design files

### Technical Details

- Powered by OpenAI GPT-4o with vision support
- Supports single element naming, batch naming, and frame structure analysis
- All API communications are encrypted with HTTPS/TLS
- Respects your design system's existing naming patterns

Transform your design workflow with AI-powered semantic naming. No more "Frame 1", "Component 2", or "Group Copy" - get meaningful, consistent names that reflect the actual purpose of your design elements.
